# Coffee Sales Analysis

One of my goals in life is to open a coffee shop that provides unique flavours for those looking to try something different and still offer coffee for those adhering to a busy schedule. I understand to properly run a coffee shop, I need to be able to manage sales and understand the performance of my items. 

I downloaded a sample dataset from Kaggle.com to help me simulate what it would look like to track the coffee sales. Theres a few things I hope to answer from this simulation to help me decide what products I need in my future store:

1.	Which product sells the most?
2.	What day and time yields the highest traffic?
3.	Is there a certain day that sells the most of one product and a different day for a different product? For example coffee sells on money but lattes sell over the weekend?
4.	How many bakery items should I leave on the shelf per day?

To answer these questions, I emplyed the following tools:
- SQL
- Tableau

To further investigate this analysis, I would look at inventory turnoverby connecting this analysis to supplier data and see how to schedule inventory restocking.
