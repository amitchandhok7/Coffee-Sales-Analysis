# Coffee Sales Analysis

One of my aspirations is to open a coffee shop that provides unique flavours for those looking to try something different and still offers coffee for those adhering to a busy schedule. I understand to properly run a coffee shop, I need to be able to manage sales and understand the performance of my items.

I downloaded a sample dataset from Kaggle.com to help me simulate what it would look like to track coffee sales. There are a few things I hope to answer from this simulation to help me decide what products I need in my future store:

1.	Which product sells the most?
2.	What day yields the highest traffic? What item is popular on that day?
3.	How many bakery items should I leave on the shelf per day?

To answer these questions, I employed the following tools:
- SQL
- Tableau

From this analysis, I found that:
•	Large Hot Chocolates are the most sold item at the cafe, with sales peaking in the winter months.
•	Fridays are the most popular day throughout the year, with espressos being the most popular choice.
•	On average, 128 bakery items sell in a day.

Based on this research, I would advise the cafe to frequently stock their hot chocolates, especially during the winter. However, it is important to cater to the crowd on Fridays by having coffee beans ready for espressos. At the same time, the cafe has perishable items that need to be managed efficiently to reduce waste. By stocking around 128 food items, they can be sure to serve all their customers.

To further investigate this analysis, I would look at inventory turnover by connecting this analysis to supplier data and see how to schedule inventory restocking.

Thank you for reading through my analysis.
