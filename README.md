# Coffee-Sales-Analysis

One of my goals in life is to open a local coffee shop that provides a unique flavour for those looking to try something different and still offer coffee for those on the go. I understand that to properly run a coffee shop, I need to be able to manage sales and understand the performance of my items. 

I downloaded sample data from Kaggle.com to help me simulate what it would look like to track the coffee sales. Theres a few things I hope to answer from this simulation to help me decide what products I need in my future store:

1.	Which product sells the most?
2.	What day and time yields the highest traffic?
3.	Is there a certain day that sells the most of one product and a different day for a different product? For example coffee sells on money but lattes sell over the weekend?
4.	How many bakery items should I leave on the shelf per day?

As part of additional analysis, I would look at the inventory turnover, to connect this analysis to a supplier table and see how frequently I would need to reorder supplies.
