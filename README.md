# Coffee Sales Analysis

One of my goals in life is to open a coffee shop that provides unique flavours for those looking to try something different and still offer coffee for those adhering to a busy schedule. I understand to properly run a coffee shop, I need to be able to manage sales and understand the performance of my items. 

I downloaded a sample dataset from Kaggle.com to help me simulate what it would look like to track the coffee sales. Theres a few things I hope to answer from this simulation to help me decide what products I need in my future store:

1.	Which product sells the most?
2.	What day yields the highest traffic? What item is popular on that day?
3.	How many bakery items should I leave on the shelf per day?

To answer these questions, I emplyed the following tools:
- SQL
- Tableau

From conducting this analysis, I found that:
- Large Hot Chocolates are the most sold item at the cafe, with sales peaking in the winter months.
- Friday's are the most popular day throughout the year, with espressos being the most popular choice.
- On average, 128 bakery items sell in a day

Based on this research, I would advise the cafe to frequently stock their hor chocolates, especially during the winters. However, it is important to cater to the crowd on Fridays by having coffee beans ready for espressos. At the same time, the cafe has perishable items that need to be managed efficiently to reduce waste. By stocking around 128 food items, they can be sure to serve all their customers.

To further investigate this analysis, I would look at inventory turnoverby connecting this analysis to supplier data and see how to schedule inventory restocking.

Thank you for reading through my analysis.
